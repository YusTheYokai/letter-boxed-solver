## How to use
There is no convenient way to use this solver yet. You'll therefore have to

1. Clone the repository
2. Change `MAX_WORDS` to the number of allowed words
3. Change the `left`, `top`, `right` and `bottom` list to the letters you want to solve for
4. Run the `main` method

It will take some time as it has not been optimized yet. The 10 shortest solutions will be printed to the console.
